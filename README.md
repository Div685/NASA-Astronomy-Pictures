# Catalogue of Astronomy. (AstroSplash)

> AstroSplash is a web app built using React and Redux. The main goal for this project was to build a website that Fetches data from API. I have used [NASA APOD](https://api.nasa.gov/) (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API in this project to fetch the photos and other details. The project contains 2 pages, the main page, and the Detail page.
- The main/index page contains a list of photos and its title.
- The Detail page contains the single photo, title, date, and Description of the photo.
- The main/index page also contains filter functionality.
- you can filter the photos using date.
